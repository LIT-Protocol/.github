## Automate and Free the Web!

Lit Protocol is a decentralized (MPC TSS) key management and private compute (TEE) network. Lit provides developers building in Web3 with three core primitives:

1. Decentralized Signing and Wallet Management with support for ECDSA and EdDSA signatures

2. Decentralized Encryption / Decryption via an identity-based BLS encryption scheme

3. Private Compute executed via Lit's MPC TSS network and sealed via TEEs (Intel SGX).

To start building with Lit, you'll need the the [js-sdk](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/js-sdk).

To learn more about how Lit works, check out the [developer docs](https://developer.litprotocol.com/) or [security docs]((https://developer.litprotocol.com/security/introduction)).
